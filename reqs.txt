Functional Tests == Acceptance Test == End-to-End
Test a User Story from User Perspective

Unit Test = Test the code

Django Project:
django-admin.py startproject spendit .


Django App:
python manage.py startapp spend

TODO: Learn difference between django project and django app

TDD Workflow
1. Write a functional test, describing the new functionality from the user’s point of view.
2. Think about how to write code that can get the FT to pass
	Write one or more unit tests to define how we want our code to behave.
	The idea is that each line of production code we write should be tested by (at least) one of our unit tests.
3. Failing unit test, we write the smallest amount of application code we can, just enough to get the unit test to pass.
	 Iterate between steps 2 and 3 a few times, until we think the functional test will get a little further.
Rerun our functional tests and see if they pass, or get a little further. That may prompt us to write some new unit tests, and some new code, and so on.
